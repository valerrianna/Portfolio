        <p>Hi! I'm Valerie Nguyen! I graduated from the University of Ottawa with a Bachelor in Health Science. I am in the process of completing the Bootcamp for Web Development at Carleton University
            I am looking for a position in the industry to fuel my creativity and to further develop my career. On my spare time I enjoy playing video games, playing the piano and drawing. 
            My portfolio should include an example of front-end development of the Run Buddy website and my art portfolio. I enjoy designing custom art and custom wedding invitations.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            My career experience is within the pharmacy. I have worked retail pharmacy interfacing with mostly customer services and preperation of medications. I then moved on to a more specialised
            pharmacy focusing on long term care facilities. Within this role I am the liaison between the pharmacist and the nursing staff caring for elderly patients who require special care.
            I recently accepted a new position with a sister company focusing on assisting patient to acquire coverage for high cost medication and to assist patient financially on crucial medications
            that are not usually accessible.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            I hope with my knowledge in health care and newfound skills in web development can be combined and ultimately improve patient care.
        </p>
